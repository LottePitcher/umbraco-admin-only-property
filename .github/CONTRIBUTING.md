# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions to this package are most welcome! 

There is a test site in the solution to make working with this repository easier.

Backoffice logins:
- Administrator: admin@admin.com / password1234567890
- Editor: editor@editor.com / password1234567890

There is a page in the content tree pre-configured with various different 'admin only' properties.

If you log in as the administrator you should see those properties. If you log in as the editor, you shouldn't!
